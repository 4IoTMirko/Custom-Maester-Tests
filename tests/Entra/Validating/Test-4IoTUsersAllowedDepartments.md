This test checks if there are any users missing or using an invalid department from the valid list.

4IoT's company policy requires that all users have a valid department on record. This is crucial for proper organizational classification.

**To remediate this issue:**

- Identify any user with an invalid or missing department.
- Submit a correction request through [Form: Invalid or Missing Department - HR Ticket](https://4IoT.service-now.com/invaliddepartment).
  - 🔺 If no action occurs within three days, escalate to HR.
