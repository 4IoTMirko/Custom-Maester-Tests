This test checks if there are any users missing or using an invalid state from the valid list.

4IoT's company policy requires that all users have a valid state. This is crucial for operational needs.

**To remediate this issue:**

- Identify any user with a missing or invalid state.
- Submit a correction request through [Form: Invalid or Missing State - HR Ticket](https://4IoT.service-now.com/usstatemissing).
  - 🔺 If no action occurs within three days, escalate to HR.
