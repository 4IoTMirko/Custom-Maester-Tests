This test checks if there are any users without a business phone assigned.

4IoT's company policy requires that all users provide a business telephone line. This is essential for internal and external communication.

**To remediate this issue:**

- Identify the users without a business phone.
- Raise a ticket in Service Now using [Form: Business Phone Missing - HR Ticket](https://4IoT.service-now.com/businessphonemissing) to request the business phone assignment for the users identified in this test.
  - 🔺 If this is not actioned in three days, escalate to the HR manager.
