This test checks if there are any users without an office location assigned.

4IoT's company policy requires that all users have an office location. This is important for workplace coordination and local requirements.

**To remediate this issue:**

- Identify the users without an office location.
- Raise a ticket in Service Now using [Form: Office Location Missing - HR Ticket](https://4IoT.service-now.com/officelocationmissing) to request the office location assignment for the users identified in this test.
  - 🔺 If this is not actioned in three days, escalate to the HR manager.
