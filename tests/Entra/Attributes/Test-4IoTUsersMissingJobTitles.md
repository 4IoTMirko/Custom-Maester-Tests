This test checks if there are any users without a job title assigned.

4IoT's company policy requires that all users have a job title assigned. This is important for role clarity and organizational hierarchy.

**To remediate this issue:**

- Identify the users without a job title.
- Raise a ticket in Service Now using [Form: Job Title Missing - HR Ticket](https://4IoT.service-now.com/jobtitlemissing) to request the job title assignment for the users identified in this test.
  - 🔺 If this is not actioned in three days, escalate to the HR manager.
