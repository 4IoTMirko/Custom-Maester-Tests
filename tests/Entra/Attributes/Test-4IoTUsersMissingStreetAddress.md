This test checks if there are any users without a street address assigned.

4IoT's company policy requires that all users have a street address assigned. This is important for accurate records and correspondence.

**To remediate this issue:**

- Identify the users without a street address.
- Raise a ticket in Service Now using [Form: Street Address Missing - HR Ticket](https://4IoT.service-now.com/streetaddressmissing) to request the street address assignment for the users identified in this test.
  - 🔺 If this is not actioned in three days, escalate to the HR manager.
