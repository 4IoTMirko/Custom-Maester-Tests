This test checks if there are any users without a country assigned.

4IoT's company policy requires that all users have a country assigned. This is important for international compliance and reporting.

**To remediate this issue:**

- Identify the users without a country.
- Raise a ticket in Service Now using [Form: Country Missing - HR Ticket](https://4IoT.service-now.com/countrymissing) to request the country assignment for the users identified in this test.
  - 🔺 If this is not actioned in three days, escalate to the HR manager.
