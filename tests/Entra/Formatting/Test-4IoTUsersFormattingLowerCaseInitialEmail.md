This test checks if user email addresses follow the policy of using given name and surname, both with capital initial separated by a dot.

4IoT's company policy requires that all users have a valid email format assigned. This is important for consistent branding and correspondence.

**To remediate this issue:**
- Identify users with an invalid or missing email format.
- Raise a ticket in Service Now using [Form: Invalid or Missing Email Format - HR Ticket](https://4IoT.service-now.com/emailmissing) to request the correct email format assignment for the users identified in this test.
  - 🔺 If not actioned in three days, escalate to the HR manager.
